# AwesomeProject

This is a simple 2 Screen app developed using React Native.

## Screen A

Screen A consists of two tabs: "Restaurants" and "Cooking". Each tab displays a carousel with item cards that are scrollable. The data rendered in the carousel is filtered based on specific properties.

### Filtering Data in Carousel

The carousel on Screen A renders data according to filter properties. The filtering logic is applied to the data before rendering it in the carousel.

## Navigation to Screen B

On Screen A, there is a "View All" button. When the "View All" button is clicked, it navigates the user to Screen B. Screen B displays all items and uses demo data for rendering purposes.
